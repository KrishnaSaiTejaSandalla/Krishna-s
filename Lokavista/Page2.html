                Delhi,[a] officially the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi, is a city and
                a union territory of India containing New Delhi, the capital of India. Straddling 
                the Yamuna river, but spread chiefly to the west, or beyond its right bank, Delhi 
                shares borders with the state of Uttar Pradesh in the east and with the state of Haryana
                in the remaining directions. Delhi became a union territory on 1 November 1956 and the NCT
                in 1995.[20] The NCT covers an area of 1,484 square kilometres (573 sq mi).[5] According 
                to the 2011 census, Delhi's city proper population was over 11 million,[6][21] while the NCT's
                population was about 16.8 million.[8]

                As India's national capital and centuries old Mughal capital, Delhi influenced the food habits of its 
                residents and is where Mughlai cuisine originated. Along with Indian cuisine, a variety of international
                cuisines are popular among the residents.[253] This variety of cuisines created a unique style of cooking 
                which became popular throughout the world, with dishes such as Kebab, biryani, tandoori. The city's classic
                dishes include butter chicken, dal makhani, shahi paneer, aloo chaat, chaat, dahi bhalla, kachori, gol gappe,
                samosa, chole bhature, chole kulche, gulab jamun, jalebi and lassi

                In 1526, Babur, a descendant of Genghis Khan and Timur from the Fergana Valley in modern-day Uzbekistan, 
                invaded India and defeated the last Lodhi sultan in the First Battle of Panipat and founded the Mughal Empire 
                that ruled from Delhi and Agra.[27] The Mughal dynasty ruled Delhi for more than three centuries, with a
                sixteen-year hiatus during the reigns of Sher Shah Suri and Hemu from 1540 to 1556.[48] Shah Jahan built 
                the seventh city of Delhi that bears his name Shahjahanabad, which served as the capital of the Mughal Empire
                from 1638 and is today known as the Old City or Old Delhi.
